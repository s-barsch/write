### Installation

Create production built:

`yarn --cwd ./app build`

Start the server:

`go run server/*go`

### Purpose

I built this app to take notes on the go and sync them with my server. It is fully operational without a network connection.

It was important to me to have the data live on my infrastructure, and have timestamps as filenames.
